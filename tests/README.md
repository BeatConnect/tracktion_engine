# BeatConnect Specific Build Information

Because of the modifications to Tracktion Engine applied in BeatConnect's codebase, the demos, tests, and examples do not run "out-of-the-box".

To build the artifacts run the `build` script included. You may need to enable the TestRunner
in order to have the script complete successfully. You may need to start the build process of generate_examples with the script, and then finish building within Visual Studio or XCode. You may need to perform any of the above tasks with elevated privileges.
